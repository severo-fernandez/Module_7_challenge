# Create a Web Application for an ETF Analyzer

In this Challenge assignment, you’ll build a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voilà library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

Instructions: 

Use this notebook to complete your analysis of a fintech ETF that consists of four stocks: GOST, GS, PYPL, and SQ. Each stock has its own table in the `etf.db` database, which the `Starter_Code` folder also contains.

Analyze the daily returns of the ETF stocks both individually and as a whole. Then deploy the visualizations to a web application by using the Voilà library.

The detailed instructions are divided into the following parts:

* Analyze a single asset in the ETF

* Optimize data access with Advanced SQL queries

* Analyze the ETF portfolio

* Deploy the notebook as a web application

## Usage

Launch this program as a web-application using the CLI and voila libraries.
